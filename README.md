## Problem
User stores tickers of publicly traded stocks he interested in in Apple's Numbers app. He needs to regularly update 20+ relevant financial ratios for each of the tickers. These can be found on finviz.com.

## Solution
This script retrieves tickers from file, parses specified financial ratios from finviz.com and then populates .numbers file with this info.
